# Batch PDF Text Scraper

This is a simple Node application that scrapes the text from all the pdf files in the `data` directory and creates corresponding text files for each of them in the `text` output folder. Can be useful for collecting machine learning data for later tokenization etc.

# How to use

1. Put the .pdf files into the `data` directory
2. Run `npm install` to get your dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to convert the pdf files. 

And that's it, I hope you find it helpful! :-)
